## T01 — react-hooks duplicate plugin (2026-09-10)

- Run every pnpm command as `nix develop -c bash -c 'unset PNPM_HOME npm_config_prefix; pnpm …'`.
  The devShell exports `PNPM_HOME`/`npm_config_prefix` as null and pnpm 10 crashes otherwise.
- Detect a duplicate plugin copy with `pnpm why eslint-plugin-react-hooks` — it lists
  every dependent and the version each resolves. Before T01: `eslint-config-next → 5.2.0`
  AND `eslint-config-react-app → 4.6.2`.
- `eslint-config-react-app` was in devDependencies but referenced by nothing; grep across the
  repo hit only `package.json` + `pnpm-lock.yaml`. `.eslintrc.js` extends `next`, not `react-app`.
- Removing the unused devDep + `pnpm install` prunes the whole orphaned subtree from
  `pnpm-lock.yaml` (554 lines: react-app, react-hooks@4.6.2, babel-preset-react-app).
- Fix style for "duplicate plugin" issues: delete the unreferenced config, never add
  `eslint-disable` and never downgrade a rule.


## T02 — 2026 refresh baseline (2026-09-10)

- Commands must run via `nix develop -c bash -c 'unset PNPM_HOME npm_config_prefix; …'`; host has no pnpm/node on PATH.
- `report-bundle-size.js` is the canonical bundle JSON writer → `.next/analyze/__bundle_analysis.json`. The `ANALYZE=true` flag only adds the treemap HTML; it does not emit a stable JSON. Global shared first-load JS: gzip 102,253 B.
- Lighthouse runs offline-of-browser via `npx -y lighthouse` with `CHROME_PATH=/etc/profiles/per-user/tom/bin/chromium`; no browser download needed.
- axe baseline: inject axe-core 4.10.3 (fetched to /tmp, NOT added to package.json) via Playwright with system chromium; drive theme with `localStorage["flowbite-theme-mode"]` in `context.addInitScript`.
- The root layout hardcodes `dark`, but the inline theme script (app/layout.tsx:48-69) removes it when the system prefers light and no stored pref exists → a fresh browser renders light. Scan both schemes explicitly.
