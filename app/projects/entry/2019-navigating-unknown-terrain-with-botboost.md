# Project Overview

> Harnessing the synergy of robotics and AI to master complex navigation challenges.

- **Project Title:** BotBoost - TurtleBot Control Program
- **Duration:** 2019
- **Role:** Lead Developer and Project Manager
- **Technologies Used:** Python 3.8, ROS (Robot Operating System), LIDAR, GPS

## Problem Statement and Objectives

- **Problem Description:** The task was to program a TurtleBot to autonomously navigate an unknown obstacle course using
  LIDAR and GPS data for real-time decision-making.
- **Project Objectives:** To develop and benchmark various control algorithms that enable a robot to complete an
  obstacle course efficiently and swiftly.
- **Target Audience/Market:** This project was geared towards academic peers, AI and robotics enthusiasts, and potential
  industry partners interested in autonomous navigation solutions.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Key Challenges:** Creating an algorithm robust enough to handle unpredictable terrain and obstacles, while
  optimizing for speed and efficiency in real-time.
- **Solutions Developed:** We implemented an array of control algorithms including the renowned A* algorithm, and
  benchmarked them against simulated robot trials to identify the most effective approach.
- **Impact of Solutions:** The deployment of these algorithms significantly improved the TurtleBot's navigation
  capabilities, leading to a more intelligent and responsive autonomous behavior.

## Development Process

- **Lifecycle Overview:** The project followed a comprehensive lifecycle, from initial concept to final benchmark
  competition.
- **Phases of Development:** We progressed through planning, algorithm selection, coding, simulation tests, and
  ultimately the competition where the bots competed.
- **Collaboration:** My role involved close collaboration with fellow students, overseeing the project while aligning
  with our collective expertise in AI and robotics.

## Achievements and Outcomes

- **Milestones:** Key milestones included the successful implementation of A* algorithm within the Python environment
  and consistent improvement in the TurtleBot’s trial runs.
- **Final Outcomes:** The culmination of the project was the competition, where bots deployed with our control program
  demonstrated superior performance.
- **Personal Learning:** This project honed my skills in AI, robotics, and project management, proving that a
  theoretical foundation coupled with practical application can lead to highly effective results.
