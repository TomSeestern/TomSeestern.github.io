# Project Overview

> SouDest - Your Gateway to Smarter, Sustainable Travel

- **Project Title:** SouDest's Backend Development
- **Duration:** 2020
- **Role:** Project Co-Developer
- **Technologies Used:** NodeJS, Passport, SQL, Google Authentication, JWT, Express

## Problem Statement and Objectives

- **Problem Description:** The challenge was to develop a backend that can handle various travel modes and deliver the
  most effective routes considering user-defined criteria such as cost, journey time, and carbon emissions.
- **Project Objectives:** Our primary goal was to create a powerful backend for our SouDest app that provides encrypted,
  cookie-handled routes, and authentication processes.
- **Target Audience/Market:** The project aims to assist travelers, particularly those who prioritize efficiency,
  cost-effectiveness, and environmentally friendly solutions.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Key Challenges:** Developing a system that would seamlessly authenticate users, manage encryption and cookies were
  among the significant hurdles in SouDest's backend development.
- **Solutions Developed:** We employed Passport for authentication, offering direct authentication with username and
  password, as well as third-party authentication such as "login with Google". Stateful sessions and sessionless routes
  via JWT were established for various use case scenarios.
- **Impact of Solutions:** These solutions enabled secure, seamless user experiences, encouraging increased app usage
  and engagement.

## Development Process

- **Lifecycle Overview:** From defining requirements and designing the backend architecture to coding, testing and
  deploying the backend server, each stage of development was thoughtful and iterative.
- **Phases of Development:** We commenced with planning, followed by execution. Rigorous testing was conducted to ensure
  system compatibility before deployment.
- **Collaboration:** I worked in harmony with my project partner, undertaking defined roles and responsibilities to
  drive project success.

## Achievements and Outcomes

- **Milestones:** The successful integration of third-party authentication and effective handling of encryption and
  cookies marked significant project milestones.
- **Final Outcomes:** The resultant SouDest backend robustly supports a multimodal travel planner system, offering users
  optimised travel routes and a seamless app experience.
- **Personal Learning:** This project honed my skills in backend development, particularly NodeJS. I also gained
  experience in designing effective user authentication and session management systems.

## Visuals and Demonstrations

- **Live Demos/Repositories:** (Provide links to demos, repositories, or documentation)

## Conclusion

- **Project Impact:** SouDest's backend has driven efficient, user-friendly interactions within the travel planner app.
  It stands as a testament to innovative backend architecture and marks a significant stride in my journey as a tech
  entrepreneur.
- **Career Reflection:** The SouDest project not only honed my backend development skills but also reconfirmed that my
  career is on the right track - towards fully automated and sustainably effective solutions.
