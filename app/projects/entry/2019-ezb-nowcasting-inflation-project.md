# Project Overview

> Spearheading a path to precision in economic forecasting through a cutting-edge AI model for nowcasting inflation.

- **Project Title:** European Central Bank: AI-Powered Inflation Nowcasting
- **Duration:** Hackathon Event (Three days)
- **Role:** Team Member and Machine Learning Developer
- **Technologies Used:** Python 3, Google Colab, Scikit-learn (Vectorizer, Logistic Regression), Seaborn

## Problem Statement and Objectives

- **Problem Description:** The challenge was to develop an AI system capable of categorizing online products into the
  correct COICOP categories—a complex task with over 5000 possibilities that is vital for calculating current inflation
  levels.
- **Project Objectives:** Our aim was to craft an AI model that outperformed other methods in accuracy, reliability, and
  robustness.
- **Target Audience/Market:** This project was targeted at economic stakeholders, including institutions like the
  European Central Bank who require precise nowcasting to make informed decisions.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Key Challenges:** The foremost challenge was managing a large variety of COICOP categories and ensuring high
  accuracy in classification amidst a diverse and novice team.
- **Solutions Developed:** We opted for a simple yet powerful model using word embedding and logistic regression, which
  provided higher accuracy than more complex alternatives like deep neural networks or binary tree classifiers.
- **Impact of Solutions:** Our solution achieved a remarkable 99.82% accuracy in classification, setting a new standard
  for reliability in this domain.

## Development Process

- **Lifecycle Overview:** The project followed an accelerated development lifecycle, typical of a hackathon.
- **Phases of Development:** Conceptualization, data preprocessing, model selection, training, testing, and validation.
- **Collaboration:** Worked intensely with a team of four master's students of varying skill sets, effectively utilizing
  each member's strengths to contribute to the project's success.

## Achievements and Outcomes

- **Milestones:** Created the most accurate AI model within the hackathon for nowcasting inflation.
- **Final Outcomes:** Successfully deployed an AI model that significantly outperformed others in classification
  challenges.
- **Personal Learning:** Gained insights into the power of simplistic models and the importance of team collaboration
  under pressure.
