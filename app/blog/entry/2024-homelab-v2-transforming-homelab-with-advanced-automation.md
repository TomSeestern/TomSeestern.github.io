# Transforming my Homelab with Advanced Automation: The 3rd Iteration Journey

Hello everyone, it's Tom Segbers here and today I'm excited to share my journey with the latest version of my Homelab.
My interest in technology and artificial intelligence is no secret to anyone, and it reflects in my projects where I
continuously strive to integrate tech advancements to create something impactful and transformative.

## Homelab V3: A New Horizon

The latest edition of my homelab is powered by a repurposed old Tower PC, now managing as a steadfast Docker and VM host
running the newest UnRaid OS. This OS has significantly facilitated the management of various services like Nextcloud,
Bitwarden, VPN, Adguard, HomeAssistant, Overleaf, Porttainer, Grafana, InfluxDB, Telegraf,
Zwave2mqtt, Automatic1111, to name a few, along with new entrants like ComfyUI.

## A Connected Ecosystem

What spices up the functionality of the Homelab is its connection with over 50+ sensors integrating both mobile and
stationary technology. This offers wide-scaled data to InfluxDB/Grafana and HomeAssistant, thus heightening the home
automation experience.

It's worth mentioning that some of these systems function on separate mediums, secluded from the regular network
traffic, to maintain a smooth technological environment.

## AI meets Homelab

As the original host lacks robustness, I am currently running a single full VM on it powered by an Ubuntu client. It has
ignited the exploration of Linux and AI realms - a perfect blend of my passions. This client is the epicenter of my
experimentations, especially with AI.

## Safety and Performance: A Dual Edge Sword

Focusing on both performance and safety, regular incremental backups are performed both onsite and offsite to ensure
secure recovery in any event of technical disruptions. With UnRaid's setup accommodating cache, normal array and parity,
the system can withstand multiple drive failures/replacements, allowing quick recovery without any downtime.
The additional cache drive is embedded to enhance system latency and overall performance.

For data protection, Local HTTPS encryption along with an OpenVPN server are also set in place.

## Enhanced Home Automation

Tapping into HomeAssistant’s diverse range of applications, I have actualized various home automation solutions. These
range from simple lighting controls to complex monitors analyzing air quality, energy consumption, and even sleep
tracking patterns!

## Wrapping Up

In conclusion, my Homelab’s 3rd iteration is focused on venturing out to innovative horizons while delivering high-end
tech solutions packed with the thrill of artificial intelligence and home automation. Keep tuning in to stay updated on
my techno-savvy adventures!
