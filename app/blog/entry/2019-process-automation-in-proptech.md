# Project Overview

> Redefining property management through innovative processes and digital transformation.

- **Project Title:** Process Automation in PropTech for Municipal Administration
- **Duration:** From January 2019 to December 2019
- **Role:** Lead IT Consultant and Developer
- **Technologies Used:** Python, SQL, MS Vision, API development, Automation testing

## Problem Statement and Objectives

- **Problem Description:** The municipal administration involved manual, time-consuming processes for managing
  properties and updating available listings on communal websites.
- **Project Objectives:** Digitize and automate manual procedures, create a single source of data truth by synchronizing
  diverse data locations, and prepare the existing display systems for relaunch.
- **Target Audience/Market:** Municipal administration, end consumers, and property management firms.
- This project aligns with the growing “PropTech” industry trend, acknowledging the necessity for automation and digital
  transformation in property management.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Key Challenges:** Resistance to change from stakeholders and technical challenges in API creation and data
  synchronization.
- **Solutions Developed:** Effective stakeholder buy-in was realized through comprehensive demonstrations and
  presentations. Successfully developed new APIs and restructured databases to support new processes.
- **Impact of Solutions:** Enhanced efficiency and accuracy of property management, streamlined processes and ensured
  consistent data across platforms.

## Development Process

- **Lifecycle Overview:** The project started with understanding existing procedures, followed by digitization, process
  improvement, system integration, and final relaunch.
- **Phases of Development:** Manual process recording, process digitization, stakeholder alignment, API and database
  development, automation of data synchronization, system integration, and relaunch.
- **Collaboration:** Worked in concert with municipal administrators, property managers, and IT teams.

## Achievements and Outcomes

  improved speed, accuracy, and reduced manual labor.
- **Personal Learning:** The project enhanced my technical skills and fortified the understanding of the importance of
  stakeholder buy-in in digital transformation projects.

## Visuals and Demonstrations

- **Screenshots/Diagrams:** Due to the sensitivity of data involved, screenshots cannot be provided. However, workflow
  diagrams can be shared upon request.
- **Live Demos/Repositories:** Confidentiality agreements prevent direct sharing of the project repository, but a
  demonstration can be arranged under certain conditions.

## Conclusion

- **Project Impact:** The project has significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of property management within
  the municipal administration, showcasing the power of digital transformation.
- **Career Reflection:** This project has been instrumental in honing my skills in process automation and database
  management. It allows me to make a tangible impact in the real estate tech space, paving the way for future
  initiatives in PropTech.
