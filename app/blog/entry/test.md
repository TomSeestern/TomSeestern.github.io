### Ingredients

- 1000 ml water.
- 10 grams dried kelp.
- 40 grams bonito flakes.

### Directions

- Lightly wipe the surface of the kelp with a tightly wrung cloth.

- Put water and kelp in a pot.

- Heat on low heat, and when small bubbles come out from the bottom of the pot (about 7 minutes), remove the kelp.

- When the kelp soup stock boils, add bonito flakes and simmer on low heat for 1 minute.

- Set a colander on a bowl, spread a paper towel on it, and strain the soup stock.

## Preservation Method

Transfer the stock to a food storage container and store in the fridge. It can be used for 2-3 days.

## Tips

- The white powder on the surface of dried kelp is "umami", so do not remove it.
